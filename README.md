Connect Four with a moderately difficult AI using C#

## Purpose
This was a project for my Artificial Intelligence University class, we were to create a Connect Four application in the
console that scales with any 2 dimensional values (Standard is 6 rows x 7 columns) and any win condition (Standard is
4 in a row). This application was to have a built-in AI that could be either first or second player.
